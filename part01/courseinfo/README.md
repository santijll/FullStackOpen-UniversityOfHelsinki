# React + Vite

These exercises have been created using Vite and React. To see the app or site, you need to install first all the required modules. For that, first download or clone the repository and then use the terminal to navigate to the folder you wish to open. Once in the folder, use npm or yarn to install the modules before running the application.

For example:

cd part01  
cd courseinfo  
npm install  
npm run dev
